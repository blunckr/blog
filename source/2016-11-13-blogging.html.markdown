# Blog about blogging

Hi. This is the first time I've ever blogged. The purpose of this blog is to
document the fun things I'm doing with technology, so why not start with
documenting the process of creating this blog? Meta, I know. I'm going to
attempt to limit the number of times I say 'blog' from here on out, cause it's
already bothering me.

Anyways, I'm primarily a Ruby developer. At least I claim to be, I likely spend
more time with JS
